This README contains the steps I do to install and setup my usual configuration of CachyOS Linux. This installation contains all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell script in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.

CachyOS comes by default with Fish shell. 
To exit fish shell
```
chsh -s /bin/bash

exec bash
```
Then clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/VictoryTek/CachyOS
cd CachyOS
chmod +x victory.sh

./victory.sh
```
Restart PC or Restart Gnome Shell

A script developed for customizing Arch, then adapted for Fedora, now adapted for Nobara.
